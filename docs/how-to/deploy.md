# Amplication Deployment

Amplication provides flexible and powerful deployment options for services generated using our platform.
This guide provides an overview of Amplication's deployment options and links to specific instructions for various deployment targets.

## Understanding Amplication's Deployment Architecture

Applications created with Amplication comprise two main components:

1. The server that runs the API
2. A database

When it comes to deployment, you have several options to choose from, allowing you to select the best approach for your development workflow and production needs.

## Deployment Options

### Docker

Amplication generates all necessary configuration and scripts for Docker deployment, making it easy to containerize your application.
