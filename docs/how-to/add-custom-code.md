# Understanding Custom Code in Amplication

This page provides an overview of how custom code works in Amplication and our vision for seamless integration between generated and custom code.

## The Vision

Our vision is to empower you to add custom code to your server while maintaining the ability to use Amplication for updating your data model, changing permissions, adding roles, and more. Amplication achieves this by merging changes via our [Smart Git Sync](/smart-git-sync/) feature, based on pre-defined policies that allow you to add and update services, controllers, resolvers, and more without losing the link to Amplication. This approach gives you the freedom and power of custom code while saving time on repetitive tasks.

## How It Works

Your Amplication-generated application is structured to allow easy and maintainable customization, with a clear separation between customizable and non-customizable code.

### Folder Structure

Each entity has a dedicated folder under the 'src' folder, containing all necessary modules and files:

```
└── src
    ├── customer
    ├── user
    ├── project
    └── task
```

Within each entity folder, files are split into two groups:

1. **Base files**: Located in the 'base' folder, these are automatically generated by Amplication with every change. **They should not be altered as they will be overwritten with each new build**.

2. **Non-base Customizable files**: These inherit from the base files and can be safely customized with your custom code. They reside directly in the entity folder.

```
src
└── Customer
    ├── Base
    │    ├── customer.controller.base.ts
    │    ├── customer.service.base.ts
    │    └── ...
    ├── customer.controller.ts
    ├── customer.service.ts
    └── ...
```

Amplication may still update the non-base files that include your custom code in certain circumstances. These updates are limited to changes necessary for preventing errors and ensuring the project can build correctly. For example, if you remove a plugin that was previously used in your service, Amplication might update the non-base files to remove references to the removed plugin, thus preventing build errors.

This approach allows Amplication to maintain the integrity of your project structure while still preserving your custom code to the greatest extent possible.

## Amplication's Approach to Custom Code

Amplication is designed to preserve your custom code while allowing for continuous updates to the generated code. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Generation**: Amplication generates both base and customizable files for each module.

2. **Subsequent Updates**: When you make changes in Amplication (e.g., updating the data model), it regenerates the base files and updates the customizable files as needed.

3. **Smart Merging**: Amplication uses [Smart Git Sync](/smart-git-sync/) to merge changes, preserving your custom code while updating the generated parts.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts arise, Amplication provides clear indications and allows you to resolve them manually.

This approach allows you to freely add custom business logic, new endpoints, or any other customizations while still benefiting from Amplication's code generation and updates.

## Considerations

- Customizing the client application (Admin UI) code is not currently supported within Amplication's regeneration process. If you need to customize the client, it's recommended to clone the entire **Admin** folder to a separate repository.
- While Amplication strives to maintain compatibility, major changes to your data model or entity structure may require manual updates to your custom code.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how custom code works in Amplication, you're ready to start adding your own business logic and customizations. For a step-by-step guide on how to add custom code to your service, check out our [How To Add Custom Code To Your Service](/add-custom-code-to-your-service) guide.

Happy coding!
