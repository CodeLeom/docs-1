# Get Started with Amplication

Welcome to Amplication's developer documentation!

Amplication is an open-source, AI-powered code generation solution for rapid .NET and Node.js development. Unlike other AI code generation tools, Amplication is the only one that guarantees production-ready code generation for all your backend needs.

## Quick Start

[Create your first service](/first-service/) with Amplication's AI, Jovu, and generate a .NET or Node.js _production-ready codebase in minutes_.

## Customize Your Generated Service

Amplication transforms your ideas into production-ready code in minutes, but we're more than just a code generator. Our platform supports you throughout the entire development process.

Use these features to fine-tune and customize your service to your exact needs:

- [Set up entities and fields](/set-up-entities/)
- [Configure roles and permissions](/configure-roles-and-permissions/)
- [Create and manage custom API endpoints and data structures](/custom-types-and-actions/)
- [Extend capabilities with plugins](/add-plugins-service/)
- [Commit changes and build](/commit-and-build-new-versions/)

## Key Features

- **[AI-powered Development](/amplication-ai/)**: Generate production-ready .NET or Node.js code, get intelligent suggestions for your service's architecture, and more with Amplication AI.
- **[Import Your Existing DB](/how-to/import-prisma-schema/)**: Use your _existing_ databases for a head start on development.
- **[Full Stack Code Generation](/getting-started/)**: Fully-functional REST and GraphQL APIs, database models, authentication, logging, React Admin UI, and more.
- **[Event-Driven Architecture](/concepts/event-driven-architecture/)**: Create new services with a modern architecture or modernize your existing apps into a event-driven microservices architecture.
- **[Seamless Git Integration](/smart-git-sync/)**: Smart git sync with GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or AWS CodeCommit.
- **[Custom Code Integration](/custom-code/)**: Extend generated code with your own custom business logic.
- **[Plugin System](/getting-started/plugins/)**: Extend functionality with our community plugins or create your custom plugins.
- **[Multiple Databases](/getting-started/#databases)**: Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server, and more.
- **[Deployment & CI/CD](/deploy/)**: Simplify and automate your CI/CD pipeline with our plugins and streamline deployments to popular options like AWS ECS, Docker Desktop, and Kubernetes.
