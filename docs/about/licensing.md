# Amplication's Licensing Model

Amplication offers both open-source and commercial licensing options to accommodate the needs of various users — from individual developers to large enterprises.

## Open Source and Enterprise Offerings

### Free Edition

- The Free Edition of Amplication includes our core functionality, based on Node.js. This edition is available under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/LICENSE) and remains free for use on our managed service at [amplication.com](https://amplication.com).
- Developers can freely access, modify, and distribute the source code available in this edition, fostering a collaborative and open development environment.

### Enterprise Edition

- The Enterprise Edition extends the Free Edition by incorporating advanced operational and security features. This edition introduces support for .NET applications, offering robust, scalable backend solutions that leverage popular .NET frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.
- This premium tier is designed for businesses seeking enhanced features like advanced data handling capabilities, increased automation, and comprehensive support for both Node.js and .NET applications.
- While the Enterprise Edition's additional functionalities are source-available, meaning the source code can be viewed and downloaded, the ownership remains with Amplication. Consequently, this code is not open-source and cannot be resold. Usage is governed by the [Amplication Terms of Service](https://amplication.com/terms).

## Amplication's Commitment to Open Source

Amplication continues to uphold a strong commitment to the open-source community. While expanding with the Enterprise Edition, we ensure that our development practices and offerings do not undermine the integrity of our open-source projects. Our policies are designed to:

- Maintain transparency about what is included as open-source.
- Prevent any exclusive delays in releasing new features to the Free Edition.
- Provide all features, including those in the Enterprise Edition, for free on the Amplication Cloud for open-source community use, catering to individual developers and small projects.

## Feature Distribution Between Editions

The distribution of features between the Free and Enterprise Editions is determined based on their utility and demand:

- Features mainly beneficial to individual developers and small projects continue to be developed under the Free Edition.
- Commercially-oriented features or those predominantly advantageous to enterprises are included in the Enterprise Edition.
